# 260519 — Competitor Research & Skill Trigger Metadata Enhancement

Date: 2026-05-19
Sources: GPT Pro (ChatGPT Pro model), Grok Expert
Method: agbrowse web-ai query against both providers with comprehensive prompts

## Research Scope

1. **Competitor/alternative landscape** for browser-based AI web UI automation
2. **Skill trigger metadata** in cli-jaw — how model names (grok, gemini, deepthink, heavy) should route to web-ai skill

## Key Findings

### 1. Competitive Landscape (Track A)
The space is no longer empty. **10x-chat** (6 providers, Playwright + Patchright) is the closest CLI competitor. **Agentify Desktop** (394 stars, CDP + MCP) targets AI-to-AI delegation. agbrowse's defensible position is: CDP-attach-first + CLI-first + normalized effort controls + session resume + copy-markdown fallback chain. No single competitor combines all six.

### 2. Media Generation Gap (Track B)
**No "agbrowse for media" exists.** Midjourney, Suno, Pika 2.5, and Udio have NO public APIs — browser automation is the only programmatic path. The recommended architecture: shared BrowserPlatform with separate TextProvider (chat) and MediaProvider (media jobs) interfaces, exposed as `agbrowse chat` and `agbrowse media` commands.

### 3. MCP Server Opportunity (Track D)
**No production MCP server automates multiple AI web UIs.** `chatgpt-automation-mcp` covers ChatGPT only. PiAPI covers media via paid proxy. agbrowse as MCP server (multi-provider chat + media via CDP-attach) would occupy a vacant niche with strong moat.

### 4. Code Generation UIs (Track D)
bolt.new and Replit Agent have zero APIs — pure CDP automation targets. v0.dev has a full SDK (skip CDP). bolt.diy (OSS) is recommended over bolt.new for initial media target.

## Research Scope (Expanded)

3. **Generative AI service landscape** — non-chat services (Midjourney, Suno, Runway, Pika, bolt.new) and their CDP automation potential
4. **Media automation architecture** — how agbrowse should expand to media generation services
5. **Top competitor deep-dives** — 10x-chat, Agentify Desktop, bolt.new automation landscape

### Track E: Skill System Reinforcement
- [14_skill_trigger_reinforcement_plan.md](14_skill_trigger_reinforcement_plan.md) — full 30-skill audit, trigger failure taxonomy (14 failure modes, expanded from 8 per GPT Pro R5), per-skill proposed triggers, cross-skill disambiguation rules, Korean trigger dictionary, phased implementation plan
- [15_web_ai_activation_fix.md](15_web_ai_activation_fix.md) — **IMPLEMENTED**: web-ai activated from skills_ref→skills, trigger keywords added (3 files), browser disambiguation added, 10-case routing verification matrix. **P0 BLOCKER**: empty-shell runtime false positive promoted per GPT Pro R5.

### Track F: GPT Pro R5 Audit (2026-05-19)
- **VERDICT**: NEEDS_FIX (1 PASS, 4 NEEDS_FIX)
- Strategy: narrowed MCP/media claims, split Move 3 into P0 reliability + P1 expansion
- Architecture: PASS (added ToS compliance gate, provider tosStatus metadata)
- Skill Triggers: extended taxonomy to 14 failure modes, promoted empty-shell to P0
- Priorities: reconciled roadmap across docs, deduplicated MCP from P1+P2→P1
- Blind Spots: added first-party computer-use agents tier (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini), quarterly watchlist

### Track G: Runway UI Selector Capture (2026-05-21)
- [16_runway_ui_selector_capture.md](16_runway_ui_selector_capture.md) — logged-in Chrome selector capture for Runway. Deep focus: Apps and Custom/tools because those are the Unlimited-relevant surfaces. Agent, Recents, Workflow, and Characters are documented as surface-only targets. Confirms Runway belongs in a separate media/runway command contract, not `web-ai`.
- [17_runway_cli_preflight.md](17_runway_cli_preflight.md) — **IMPLEMENTED**: first `agbrowse runway` command slice. Adds selector contract, current-tab status inspection, Apps/Custom open/preflight navigation, read-only queue/completion polling, and a hard safety contract that blocks Generate/Run all/payment/submission controls.
- [18_runway_custom_live_probe.md](18_runway_custom_live_probe.md) — logged-in Computer Use live probe of Runway Custom. Maps Video/Image/Audio mode controls, all observed Custom model categories, asset upload behavior, and one explicit Seedance 2.0 video generation lifecycle from queue to completed video player.
