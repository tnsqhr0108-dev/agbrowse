# agbrowse  indexdevlog 

agbrowse is a CLI shipped in `bin/` (`agbrowse`, `web-ai`, `skills/browser`).
 Phase 22) is now merged into `main` and is the
release baseline. Per-phase devlogs are filed under `_fin/mvp/<topic>/` and
must be treated as historical  do not edit them after release.evidence 

> Active capability claims live in `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md`
> and `structure/phase_status.md` (single source of truth, gated by
> `gate:truth-table-fresh`). This index is only a navigator.

## Deferred / incomplete

The following were planned but explicitly not in MVP scope and are kept at the
devlog root instead of `_fin/mvp/`:

| Phase | File | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  remote CDP adapters | `20_phase19_remote_cdp_adapters.md` | Deferred (`docs/EXTERNAL_CDP.md`); no production runtime. |19 

## Forbidden

- Editing files under `_fin/mvp/` after MVP  they are evidence ofmerge 
  shipped state. New work must go in a new devlog under `_plan/` or a new
  topic folder.
- Adding `ready` claims that are not also reflected in
  `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md` and the cli-jaw mirror in the same
  commit.
