# agbrowse  indexdevlog 

agbrowse is a CLI shipped in `bin/` (`agbrowse`, `web-ai`, `skills/browser`).
 Phase 22) is now merged into `main` and is the
release baseline. Per-phase devlogs are filed under `_fin/mvp/<topic>/` and
must be treated as historical  do not edit them after release.evidence 

> Active capability claims live in `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md`
> and `structure/phase_status.md` (single source of truth, gated by
> `gate:truth-table-fresh`). This index is only a navigator.

## Layout

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `_fin/` | Completed non-MVP closeouts, research outcomes, and shipped implementation plans. |
| `_fin/mvp/` | Shipped MVP phases, grouped by topic (read-only history). |
| `_plan/` | Active or deferred plans not yet shipped. |
| `_fin/_legacy/` | Pre-rewrite changelogs / plans / research dumps, closed as historical records. |
| `context/` | Verbatim Pro / Grok peer reviews and gap audits. |

## `_plan/` active or deferred work

| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle stability gap analysis | `_plan/260608_oracle_stability_gap/` | Partial follow-up backlog; includes 2026-06-20 Oracle 0.15 delta and 31/32 PABCD follow-up plans. |
| cli-jaw web-ai parity mirror | `_plan/260621_cli_jaw_webai_parity/` | External cli-jaw mirror plan; verify closeout in cli-jaw before moving from agbrowse `_plan`. |

Other grouped planning folders under `_plan/` remain until they receive a
separate closeout audit.

## Deferred / incomplete

The following were planned but explicitly not in MVP scope and are kept at the
devlog root instead of `_fin/mvp/`:

| Phase | File | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  remote CDP adapters | `20_phase19_remote_cdp_adapters.md` | Deferred (`docs/EXTERNAL_CDP.md`); no production runtime. |19 

## Forbidden

- Editing files under `_fin/mvp/` after MVP  they are evidence ofmerge 
  shipped state. New work must go in a new devlog under `_plan/` or a new
  topic folder.
- Adding `ready` claims that are not also reflected in
  `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md` and the cli-jaw mirror in the same
  commit.
