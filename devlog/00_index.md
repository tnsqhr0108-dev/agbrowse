agbrowse is a CLI shipped in `bin/` (`agbrowse`, `web-ai`, `skills/browser`).
 Phase 22) is now merged into `main` and is the
release baseline. Per-phase devlogs are filed under `_fin/mvp/<topic>/` and
must be treated as historical  do not edit them after release.evidence 

> Active capability claims live in `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md`

## `_plan/` active research

| Topic | Folder | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K-BrowseComp search gap analysis | `_plan/260608_kbrowsecomp_search_gap/` | Research/spec complete; implementation deferred. |
| web-ai GPT Code Mode (artifact zip 회수) | `_plan/260611_webai_gpt_code_mode/` | Implemented as ChatGPT-only beta: single zip, multi-zip, and JS-only artifact retrieval verified. |
| web-ai code mode GPT dev-agent context | `_plan/260611_code_mode_gpt_agent_context/` | Active: auto-upload saved GPT dev-agent context zip, require `PLAN.md`/`00_plan.md`, and mirror independent runtime into cli-jaw. |
| web-ai skill + cli-jaw mirror closeout | `_plan/260611_webai_skill_cli_jaw_mirror/` | Active: update agent-facing skill docs and mirror the simplified ChatGPT Intelligence picker into cli-jaw. |
| Background runtime hook research | `_plan/260611_background_runtime_hook/` | Research complete; findings reflected in `skills/web-ai/SKILL.md` (Long-Running section). Hook design relocated to cli-jaw `devlog/_plan/260611_bgtask_background_runtime/` for implementation planning. |
| ChatGPT composer tool selection live probe | `_plan/260615_chatgpt_composer_tools_live_probe.md` | Active: PR #78 live DOM/UX evidence for explicit-only tool/plugin/model gating. |

## Deferred / incomplete

The following were planned but explicitly not in MVP scope and are kept at the
devlog root instead of `_fin/mvp/`:

| Phase | File | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  remote CDP adapters | `20_phase19_remote_cdp_adapters.md` | Deferred (`docs/EXTERNAL_CDP.md`); no production runtime. |19 

## Forbidden

- Editing files under `_fin/mvp/` after MVP  they are evidence ofmerge 
  shipped state. New work must go in a new devlog under `_plan/` or a new
  topic folder.
- Adding `ready` claims that are not also reflected in
  `structure/CAPABILITY_TRUTH_TABLE.md` and the cli-jaw mirror in the same
  commit.
